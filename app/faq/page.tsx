      },
      {
        q: "Is a ChatGPT account required?",
        a: "No. Membership uses a separate Member ID and password issued by the administrator. No third-party account is needed to register or sign in.",
      },
      {
        q: "How long does approval take?",
        a: "The administrator reviews applications manually. You will receive your Member ID and temporary credentials only after verification is complete — there is no automatic approval.",
      },
      {
        q: "What if I forget my Member ID or password?",

        q: "How do I search for a seller?",
        a: "Once logged in, use the seller search feature. You must enter the seller's exact 15-character GSTIN — there is no partial or name-based search. This prevents enumeration and protects seller privacy.",
      },
      {
        q: "What information do search results show?",
        a: "Approved reports for that seller within your category: ratings, dispute history, resolution status, and factual summaries. GSTINs are masked (only last 4 digits visible) and review notes are never exposed to other members.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I see reports from other categories?",
        a: "No. Category isolation is enforced. Agriculture members see only agriculture reports; 'Other' category members see only other-category reports. This prevents competitive intelligence leaking to rivals.",
      },
      {
        q: "What if a seller's information is wrong?",

      },
      {
        q: "What happens after I submit a report?",
        a: "Reports start in 'pending' status. An administrator reviews the submission, verifies identity and evidence, and either approves (making it searchable) or rejects it. You receive a notification when the decision is made.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I edit a report after submission?",
        a: "Pending reports can be edited. Approved reports can only be changed by requesting a revision, which returns to admin approval. This preserves the integrity of the historical ledger.",
      },
      {
        q: "How are disputes resolved?",
        a: "You can submit a dispute resolution request with the resolution date, resolved amount, and a description. An administrator reviews and approves or rejects the resolution. Resolved disputes are marked accordingly.",

    category: "Security",

      {
        q: "How are my credentials protected?",
        a: "Passwords are hashed with scrypt (a memory-hard key derivation function) and verified with timing-safe comparison. Session cookies are httpOnly, secure (in production), and sameSite=strict. Only a SHA-256 digest of the session token is stored server-side.",
      },
      {
        q: "What happens if I enter the wrong password too many times?",
        a: "After five incorrect attempts, your account is locked for 15 minutes. Repeated failed logins trigger a security event and notify the administrator. This protects against brute-force attacks.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can someone else use my account simultaneously?",
        a: "Only one active session is allowed per member. A new login replaces any earlier session and notifies you. If you receive this notification unexpectedly, change your password immediately and contact the administrator.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is my GSTIN visible to other members?",
        a: "No. GSTINs are HMAC-SHA256 hashed before storage. Other members see only the last four digits. Your full GSTIN is never exposed in search results or reports.",

    category: "Data & privacy",
    icon: Lock,
    items: [
      {
        q: "How long is my data retained?",
        a: "Rejected applications and reports: 30 days after rejection (subject to legal holds). Approved reports and audit records: retained as part of the commercial-history ledger while the platform operates. In-app notifications: 10 days. Deactivated accounts: retained until deletion is approved.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I close my account?",
        a: "Submit an account-deletion request from the member dashboard. An administrator reviews and approves it. After closure, approved historical reports may remain but your member-facing attribution is anonymised where possible.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I request my data be corrected?",
        a: "Yes. Use the profile-change request flow in the member dashboard, or email the grievance officer. For seller record corrections, provide the GST certificate and relevant facts.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is the platform a credit rating or blacklist?",
        a: "No. The platform is one due-diligence input only. It does not provide credit ratings, guarantee payment, or recommend trading decisions. Always independently verify before acting.",
